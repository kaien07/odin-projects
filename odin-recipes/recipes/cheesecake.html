        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Crust:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>19 honey graham crackers, crushed</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cheesecake:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (8 ounce) packages of cream cheese, cut into cubes, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups of white sugar</li>
                <li>4 jumbo eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/8 cup all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C. Fill a large, round, disposable 
                aluminum pan with about 1/2 inch of water to create a water bath.</li>
            <li>Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter for crust in 
                a bowl. Mix until well combined and spread evenly in a 9-inch 
                springform pan. Press down firmly on crumbs with a small, flat-bottom 
                bowl or glass, all over the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of 
                the pan.</li>
            <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes. Remove 
                crust and set aside to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 165 degrees C.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer 
                until smooth. Add sugar and mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating 
                batter briefly after each addition. Continue to add ingredients, one 
                at a time, beating after each addition until blended, in this order: 
                sour cream, heavy cream, vanilla extract, and flour. Pour cheesecake 
                batter onto the crust and place carefully into the prepared water bath. 
                The water level should be about 3/4 of the height of the springform 
                pan; adjust as necessary.</li>
            <li>Bake cheesecake until the sides appear solid and the center appears 
                just undercooked, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Turn the oven off, but 
                do not open the oven door. Let the cheesecake cool in the water bath 
                for 3 to 4 hours; the center will continue to cook slowly.</li>
            <li>Open the oven door slightly and keep the cheesecake inside for 1 more 
                hour. Remove from the oven and transfer the cheesecake from the water 
                bath to a wire rack. Cool for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator 
                until firm and fully chilled, at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Run a thin metal knife along the sides of the springform pan, then 
                unlock the pan and slip the side section up and over the cheesecake. 
                Run a knife under hot water, dry it quickly, then slide it from left 
                to right between the bottom of the pan and the bottom of the cake. 
                Slide the cake to a cake liner or platter.</li>
        </ol>
